                <h1>Dutch Hospital Shopping Precinct</h1>
                <p>This is in the old Dutch Hospital the oldest building in Colombo in the Colombo Fort area. It was built as a hospital for the Dutch in 1681 to look after the officers and other staff of the Dutch East India Company. It was transformed into a shopping and dining precinct and the historic architecture has been preserved. At least I could get a decent feed as had KFC and Burger King and dining otherwise very expensive and tax added too</p>
